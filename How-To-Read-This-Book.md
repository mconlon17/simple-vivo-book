# How to Read This Book

Who has time to read a book?  We want to read what we need and get going.  This book can be read from cover to cover, but that's not necessary.  Here's what you need to read:

## Data Managers

Read [Simple VIVO](Simple-VIVO.md) and the chapters pertaining to the materials you want to manage.  Not every VIVO site will manage all the various materials.

## Programmers

Read the [Preface](Preface.md) and skip to [The Pump](Home.md) and all that follows.

## System Administrators

Read [Getting Started](Getting-Started.md).  For your data managers and programmers to use Simple VIVO, you will need to enable the VIVO SPARQL API.  See the VIVO documentation.  You will need to provide the API URI, and a username and password for an account authorized to read and write VIVO data through the API.

You may also need to help your data manager with a command line environment suitable for running Python programs such as Simple VIVO.
