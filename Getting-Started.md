# Getting Started with Simple VIVO

To start using Simple VIVO to manage data in your VIVO, you will need the following:

1. A VIVO to use for data management.  VIVO is typically deployed at the organizational level, much like a web server.  Simple VIVO is used to manage the data in an existing VIVO.  The existing VIVO may be "empty" \(as delivered VIVO, has a small amount of data pertaining to countries, states and territories of the United States, and data about its own definitions\). Simple VIVO can also be used with VIVO Vagrant, a VIVO which can be installed on your local machine.
   Your VIVO must allow the VIVO SPARQL API to be used.  By default, this is turned off.  Your system administrator 
   will need to turn it on and provide you with a username and password for you to use to manage data in your VIVO.
2. You will need to be able to run Python 2.7 from a command line.  If this is new to you, a system administrator can 
   help you prepare your machine, and show you how to use the command line.
3. You will need to have the VIVO Pump and Simple VIVO installed on your machine.  This is very simple to do.  Once 
   Python is installed, you can type: `pip install vivo-pump` at the command line prompt.
4. You will need to edit the Simple VIVO configuration file `sv.cfg` to provide four pieces of information:
   1. The URL of your VIVO SPARQL API.  Your system administrator will have this value
   2. The username required to access your VIVO SPARQL API
   3. The password required to access your VIVO SPARQL API
   4. The URI pattern you would like Simple VIVO to use when created new URI \(see below\)

With these things in place, you are ready to manage data in VIVO using spreadsheets.

## URI patterns

In VIVO, everything has a URI, a Uniform Resource Identifier.  Simple VIVO can be used to create new things in   
your VIVO, adding grants, or people, or dates, or educational background.  Everything that is added will have its   
own URI.  Simple VIVO makes URI that look like:

```
PatternNumber
```

Where pattern is a pattern you supply, and Number is a random number generated by Simple VIVO for each new thing   
it creates.  Simple VIVO checks to make sure the number it is create  
One is not already in use in your VIVO.

Your pattern should like `http://yourvivourl/individual/n`

Let's looks at each part of the pattern and see what options might exist for you

`http://` This is required.  All VIVO URI are addresses on the semantic web.

`yourvivourl`  Many organizations have VIVO URLs that look like `VIVO.school.edu` or something similar. Your   
system administrator can provide the URL of your VIVO.

`individual`  This is the VIVO default.  Some VIVO sites use alternate words.  Your system administrator can   
tell you what word is used at your site.

`n`  This is the default.  You can use any word or letter you like.  You may prefer that dates have uri with   
the word date.  Person might be used for uri for people.

Let's put all the pieces go ether in an example.

Example:  The University of Florida has a VIVO at `http://VIVO.ufl.edu`.  They use the word individual.  They   
also have all their VIVO uri starting with n.  Their uri pattern for all their Simple VIVO work is

```
http://VIVO.ufl.edu/individual/n
```

Simple VIVO will make uri that look like `http://VIVO.ufl.edu/individual/n883882`

Example 2:  mythical university has a VIVO at `http://profiles.mythical.org`.  They use the word "u"  to refer to   
all uri in their system.  They use different prefixes for uri referring to different things.

```
http://profiles.mythical.org/u/date is the prefix they use for dates
http://profiles.mythical.org/u/grant is the prefix they use for grants
```

And so on

Each uri prefix is put in the config used to manage each type of thing.

Simple VIVO will make uri. That look like `http://profiles.mythical.org/u/date774883` for a date,   
and `http://profiles.mythical.org/u/grant884001` for a grant.

## Testing your set up

Once you have all the pieces in place --  a VIVO, Python, the Pump and Simple VIVO, and the four parameters in   
your `sv.cfg` file, you can test your setup by going to a command line, and typing:

```
 python sv.py -a test
```

`sv.py` is the name of the Simple VIVO program.

The word `python` is required.  It tells the system "I'm asking you to run a Python program and here's its name"

The `sv.py` is required.  It tells python "the name of the program I would like to run is `sv.py` and you can   
find it in the current directory."  If `sv.py` is not in the current directory, you can change to the directory it is  
in to run it, or use a path to indicate where `sv.py` is located.

The `-a test` command line parameter tells Simple VIVO that you would like to run the test to see that Simple   
VIVO is set up correctly.

If you have python installed and `sv.py` where python will find it, and you have typed the command line correctly,   
Simple VIVO will respond with a list of the parameters configured for Simple VIVO and the results of a connection  
test with VIVO.  For example:

```
mymac$ python sv.py -a test

Notice toward the bottom "Simple VIVO is ready for use."  You're good to go!

If things aren't quite right, the test will respond with one or more error messages.  The most common errors   
have to do with specification of   
the configuration file for accessing your VIVO SPARQL API.  In some cases, your VIVO may not be accepting   
connections, or your username and password may not be authorized, or your uri pattern may be invalid.  
Work with your system administrator to get VIVO set up properly and the parameters needed to access VIVO set up   
properly in your `sv.cfg` file.

## Tests passed and good to go

With tests passed, you are ready to use Simple VIVO.  Please read the introduction to Simple VIVO that follows, and then try one or more examples.
