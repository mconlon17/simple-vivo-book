# API
An Application Program Interface (API) is a collection of programming routines and definitions for
 requesting data or actions from a piece of software, and receiving results from software.
 
# DOI
Document Object Identifier.  A Unique identifier assigned by the publisher of a work to unqiuely identify the work.

# EISSN
Electronic ISSN.  The ISSN for the electronic (on-line) version of a journal.  See ISSN.

# graph
The collection of triples representing the scholarship of an organization can be represented as a graph of nodes and arcs, where nodes represent entities and literal values, and arcs represent relationships between the nodes.

# ISNI
The International Standard Name Identifier (ISNI) is a sixteen digit number assigned to persona and organizations
in the publishing ecosystem.  See [isni.org](http://isni.org)
 
# ISSN
International Standard Serial Number.  An eight digit identifier assigned to each journal in the world to 
uniquely identify that journal.  See [issn.org](http://issn.org)

# JSON
JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) is a data format that is easy for machines and people to read and 
write.  See [JSON.org](http://json.org) and the 
[JSON Wikipedia Page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON)

# Ontology
"In computer science and information science, an ontology is a formal naming and definition of the types, properties, and interrelationships of the entities that really or fundamentally exist for a particular domain of discourse." *Wikipedia*

VIVO uses several ontologies in common use on the semantic web, as well as VIVO-ISF, an ontology for scholarship, developed for use with VIVO.

# Orcid
The Open Researcher and Contributor Identifier.  A sixteen digit number assigned to a researcher for the purpose
of uniquely identifying that researcher in the scholarly publishing ecosystem.  See [orcid.org](http://orcid.org)

# Python
Python is a popular programming language for scientific, graphical and text programming.  See
[python.org](http://python.org)

# Pump
The VIVO Pump is python software for adding, removing and updating data in VIVO using spreadsheets.

# RDF
Resource Description Framework (RDF) is a way to represent information that is useful for machines.  RDF uses triples to represent information.

# Semantic Web
The semantic web is an effort to provide open data in standard formats for reuse at web scale.

# Triples
RDF represents data using triples of the form

    subject predicate object
    
Each element of the triple is defined to be a URI or a literal value.  Using triples represented using RDF, and ontologies that provide standard meaning for the elements of the triples, VIVO can represent scholarship in a scalable, sharable, well-defined, way.

# Triple Store
A triple store is a database designed to manage triples.

# URL
Uniform Resource Locator.  An address that can be used on the Internet to uniquely identify a resource.

# URI
Uniform Resource Identifier.  A pattern that can be used to uniquely identify a resource.  All URL are URI, but not all URI identify resources on the the network.  Some URI are designed for internal or off-line use.


# VIVO
VIVO is an open source, semantic web software system for creating and maintaining an integrated 
view of the scholarly work of an organization.  See [the VIVO Home Page](http://vivoweb.org)

# VIVO Vagrant
Vagrant is software for providing a self-contained computing environment on your machine.  VIVO Vagrant is a full
featured VIVO that runs in a Vagrant environment.

# VIVO-ISF
The VIVO Integrated Semantic Framework, the ontology used by VIVO to represent scholarship.
