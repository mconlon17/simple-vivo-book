# Versions of VIVO

Simple VIVO works using definitions files that "map" your spreadsheet rows and columns to VIVO's internal data models.
VIVO's internal data models are defined using several "ontologies."  As with software, ontologies have versions.
Some changes in ontologies provide new capabilities for representing additional kinds of objects, or provide
additional attributes for existing objects.  But some ontology changes require changes to existing VIVO objects and the maps to them used by Simple
VIVO.

The version of Simple VIVO described in this book is for use with VIVO 1.6 and above.  These versions all use the 
same ontology (VIVO-ISF 1.6) and can all run the examples in this book.

At some point, VIVO will be updated to new versions of ontologies that require mapping changes.  When that happens, the
Simple VIVO software will be updated to reflect the VIVO changes as reflected in the ontology changes.
