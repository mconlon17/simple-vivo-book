# How to Read This Book

Who has time to read a book?  We want to read what we need and get going.  This book can be read from cover to cover, but that's not necessary.  Here's what you need to read:

## Data Managers

Read [Simple VIVO](Simple-VIVO.md) and the chapters pertaining to the materials you want to manage.  Not every VIVO site will manage all the various materials.

## Programmers

Read the [Preface](Preface.md) and skip to [The Pump](Home.md) and all that follows.
