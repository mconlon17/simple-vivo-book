# Writing Definitions
The Pump uses a definition file to define how data can be retrieved from VIVO to a spreadsheet, and how data in a spreadsheet can be updated in VIVO.  A single definition file defines both the get action and the update action.

Round tripping is the ability to get data from VIVO to a spreadsheet, edit that spreadsheet and use the same definition to update VIVO.  You can also start from the update -- adding new data to VIVO, and then using the same definition to get the data from VIVO.

In this chapter we will see simple examples first.  You should try these simple examples.  And you should check your work.
