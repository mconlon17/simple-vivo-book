# Managing More Data

The examples provided with Simple VIVO manage quite a bit of data, and many of the most common scenarios
for keeping track of the scholarly work of the people of the institution.  But your institution may wish
to extend the scholarly record to track more data.  You may wish to track datasets and/or software created 
by faculty, or patents obtained, or resources used, or projects completed.  There is no end to the types of
work you can track with Simple VIVO.

In this chapter we will look at extending the delivered scenarios by adding attributes to the existing scenarios,
by adding new scenarios for scholarly work already modeled in VIVO, and finally, by adding completely new
types of work.
